### How to view

You can view the build by either cloning this repo and running 

```bash
npm install
```

from inside the directory of your checkout.  Then running:

```bash
npm run start
```
to start the webpack dev server.  OR....

just go here:

https://infn8.github.io/pixel-perfect-coding-challenge/dist/

to view the current state of the `dist` folder on the `gh-pages` branch - where that folder is not ignored.
